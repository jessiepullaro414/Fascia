"""
Verified pinouts for the carrier's active parts.

Every entry here was read out of the part's own datasheet, not recalled.
Each block cites its source document so a future revision can be
re-checked rather than re-guessed. Pin tuples are:

    (pin_number, pin_name, electrical_type)

using KiCad's electrical-type vocabulary, so build_schematic.py can hand
them straight to the symbol factory.

Notes marked GOTCHA are things that will destroy a board or silently not
work, and that contradict the obvious default.

# LM74930-Q1 - automotive ideal diode surge stopper with circuit breaker,
# overvoltage protection and fault output.
# Source: TI SNOSDF6, October 2023. VQFN-24 (RGE).
#
# GOTCHA: the exposed thermal pad (RTN) must be left FLOATING. The
# datasheet says explicitly "Leave exposed pad floating. Do Not connect to
# GND plane." That is the opposite of the usual VQFN convention, so the
# footprint and any ground-stitching pass need a deliberate exception.
#
# GOTCHA: OVCLAMP (16) tied to OV (5) selects overvoltage CLAMP with
# circuit-breaker timing, i.e. the part regulates through a surge instead
# of just disconnecting. Tied to GND instead, that behaviour is disabled.

# Source: TI SLLSF17D, August 2019, revised March 2025. SOIC-8 (D),

#
# GOTCHA: the "V" suffix is load bearing. Per the datasheet's own device
# comparison table, TCAN1044-Q1 has pin 5 as a No-Connect while
# TCAN1044V-Q1 has it as VIO. The Verdin's I/O is 1.8 V logic, so ordering
# the non-V part yields a board that assembles perfectly and never talks.
#
# GOTCHA: VCC wants 4.5-5.5 V (so the 5 V rail), while VIO wants the 1.8 V
# rail to match the module. They are different supplies, each needing its
# own 100 nF close to the pin.

# LM61460-Q1 - automotive 3-36 V, 6 A low-EMI synchronous buck.
# Source: TI SNVSB70F, May 2019, revised June 2021. VQFN-HR-14 (RJR).
#
# GOTCHA: BIAS (1) is not a bypass pin. It feeds the internal LDO and
# should be tied to the OUTPUT rail to improve efficiency - but only while
# Vout is at or below 12 V. Above that the datasheet says tie it to
# ground. At our 5 V output it goes to the output.
#
# GOTCHA: three pins must not float AND must not be grounded - FB (4),
# RT (6) and EN/SYNC (7). Grounding RT is a particularly easy mistake
# since most "set with a resistor to ground" pins tolerate it.
#
# GOTCHA: AGND (3) must connect to BOTH PGND1 (9) and PGND2 (11) on the
# PCB, and VIN1/VIN2 and PGND1/PGND2 each need a low-impedance connection
# to their pair. These are one net electrically but a real layout
# constraint, not something the schematic alone captures.
#
# RBOOT (13) sets the SW-node rise time, so it is the EMI knob on this
# part - relevant here given LVDS and a car radio share the enclosure.
